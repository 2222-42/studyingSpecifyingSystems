# What I don't know

Let 'A' be an action which changes v.

Question: What is the difference between the following expressions and their meanings?

1. `[][A]_v`
2. `[]<A>_v`

`[A]_v
\equiv A \/ (v' = v)`

`<A>_v ("angle A sub v")
\equiv A /\ (v' # v)`

the formula [][A]_v is invariant under stuttering
